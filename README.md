# Overview
This project allows you to deploy a highly available, scalable, and secure multi-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform. The architecture consists of the following three tiers:
1. **Web Tier**: This tier handles incoming user requests and can be horizontally scaled for increased capacity. It includes web servers and a load balancer for distributing traffic.
2. **Application Tier**:  Application servers run the business logic and interact with the database tier. They can also be horizontally scaled to meet demand.
3. **Database Tier**: The database stores and manages the application data. We are using Amazon RDS for a managed database service in this architecture.
